                <p>
                Key West possesses a unique blend of Cuban, West Indian, Bahamian, and American atmosphere. 
                The city is known for its architecture, particularly its many 19th-century wooden homes, and 
                as a haven for writers, artists, and those preferring less conventional lifestyles. Our tiny 
                island is steeped in history, and you can’t help but fall in love with our dialed-up-to-11, 
                old-world charm. From the ornate latticework of our architecture and our chocolate-box neighborhoods 
                to the iconically circusy Mallory Square, Key West exudes a unique character that sets us apart from 
                any other place. The southernmost point in the United States, is famous for watersports, lively 
                nightlife, beaches, historic sites and its pastel, conch-style architecture. Last but not least, 
                a “winter wonderland” in Key West looks more like a beautiful beach paradise. With temperatures 
                generally hovering in the mid-70s each day and hardly ever dropping below 65 degrees, it’s 
                no wonder so many tourists choose to flock to our magnificent little island each year at this time!</p>
